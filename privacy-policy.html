<h1>Sruti Trainer — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Sruti Trainer ("the App") is a Carnatic music pitch training app developed by VK. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how the App works.</p>

<h2>Microphone Access</h2>
<p>The App requests access to your device's microphone solely to analyse your singing pitch in real time. Audio from the microphone is processed entirely on your device using the Web Audio API. No audio is recorded, stored, saved to files, or transmitted to any server. The microphone data is used only for live pitch detection during an active practice session and is discarded immediately after processing.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>Sruti Trainer does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Specifically:</p>
<p>We do not collect your name, email address, or any identifying information. We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We do not transmit any data over the internet. The App functions entirely offline.</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p>The App stores your practice scores and session history locally on your device using browser local storage. This data never leaves your device and can be cleared at any time using the "Clear history" option within the App.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Sruti Trainer does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs. The App loads Google Fonts for visual styling, which is the only external network request made by the App.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The App is suitable for all ages as it collects no personal information.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated date at the top of this page.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: Vandana_karthik@yahoo.com</p>
